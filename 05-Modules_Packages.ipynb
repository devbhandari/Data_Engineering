    "# What does ‚Äúcode at indentation level zero‚Äù mean?\n",
    "# In Python, indentation is used to define code blocks (like inside a function or loop).\n",
    "# Indentation level zero means code that is not indented at all ‚Äî it sits at the top level of your file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#if __name__==\"__main__\" : \n",
    "\n",
    "# What is if __name__ == \"__main__\": in Python?\n",
    "# This line is a special conditional that lets you control what code runs when your file is run directly vs. when it's imported into another file.\n",
    "\n",
    "# if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "# This means:\n",
    "# Only run the following code if this file is being run directly (not imported as a module).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Behind the scenes:\n",
    "# Every Python file has a built-in variable called __name__.\n",
    "# If the file is run directly, __name__ == \"__main__\" ‚úÖ\n",
    "# If the file is imported, __name__ == \"filename\" ‚ùå\n",
