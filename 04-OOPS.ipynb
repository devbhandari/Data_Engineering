    "An object is a real, usable thing built using the class (blueprint).\n",
    "üî∏ Real-World Example:\n",
    "From one car design, we can create many actual cars: a red car, a blue car, a fast car, etc.\n",

    "A special method that runs automatically when you create an object. It‚Äôs used to give the object its initial values (like color, brand, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "üî∏ Real-World Example:\n",
    "When a car comes off the assembly line, it gets its brand, color, engine ‚Äî this is what the constructor does.\n",
