    "\n",
    "1) class – Blueprint or Template\n",
    "🔸 What it is:\n",
    "A class is like a blueprint for creating objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔸 Real-World Example:\n",
    "Think of a Car Company. It has a design (blueprint) for a car — that’s the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔸 Python Example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    pass  # placeholder for now\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. object – Actual Thing Created from the Class\n",
    "🔸 What it is:\n",
    "An object is a real, usable thing built using the class (blueprint).\n",
    "🔸 Real-World Example:\n",
    "From one car design, we can create many actual cars: a red car, a blue car, a fast car, etc.\n",
    "🔸 Python Example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "car1 = Car()  # creating an object\n",
    "car2 = Car()\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __init__() – Constructor\n",
    "🔸 What it is:\n",
    "A special method that runs automatically when you create an object. It’s used to give the object its initial values (like color, brand, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "🔸 Real-World Example:\n",
    "When a car comes off the assembly line, it gets its brand, color, engine — this is what the constructor does.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Simple definition:\n",
    "The __init__ function is a special function that automatically runs when you create a new object from a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Think of it like:\n",
    "When a car is made, the factory worker puts on its brand label and paints it a color — that’s what __init__ does.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔸 Python Example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand, color):\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",
    "        self.color = color\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "car1 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Red\")  # constructor runs here\n",
    "\n",
    "4. self – Refers to the Current Object\n",
    "🔸 What it is:\n",
    "The keyword self is used inside the class to refer to the specific object being worked on.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔸 Real-World Example:\n",
    "Each car has its own color and brand. self helps each object keep its own values.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Simple definition:\n",
    "self refers to the object that is calling the function.\n",
    "It lets you store and access the object’s own data.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Think of it like:\n",
    "“Me” inside the car.\n",
    "Each car says: “My brand is Toyota” or “My color is Red”.\n",
    "That “my” is self.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why not just use brand and color directly?\n",
    "Because many objects (cars) may be created.\n",
    "Each needs its own values. self keeps data separate for each object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Summary\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "another explanation for self:\n",
    "What does self mean?\n",
    "Think of a class like a blueprint, and each object (like a real cylinder) made from that blueprint as having its own personal details — like its own height and radius.\n",
    "🔑 self refers to \"this particular object\".\n",
    "For example, if you create two cylinders:\n",

    "🔸 What it is:\n",

    "A car has attributes like brand, color, speed.\n",
    "\n",

    "6. Methods (Functions inside a Class)\n",
    "🔸 What it is:\n",
    "Methods are functions that belong to a class and usually act on the object's data.\n",
    "🔸 Real-World Example:\n",
    "A car can start, stop, honk — these are actions or methods.\n",
    "🔸 Python Example:\n",

    "Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data into one class. It also involves restricting direct access to some components using private attributes.\n",
