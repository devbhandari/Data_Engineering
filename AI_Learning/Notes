AI: consists of 
    1)Computer Vision : 
    2)NLP : 
    3)Generative AI :
    4)Deep Learning : Multi Layered neural networks,automatically extract features from big data 
    5)Machine Learning: 
        ~ Uses algorithms, requires feature engineering
        ~ Teaches computer to learn from data, identify patterns and make decision
        ~ Algorithms : used computational methods for learning, Does not rely on a fixed algorithm
            a) Supervised learning models: train on labelled data to learn how to make inferenes on new data,Enabling them to predict otherwise unknown labels.
            b) UnSupervised Learning models:Works without labels by finding patterns in data.
            c) Semisupervised learning trains on relatively small subset of the data that is already labeled.

Example : 
Pharma Warehouse
Imagine a pharmaceutical warehouse where medicines are stored, picked, packed, and shipped. There are thousands of SKUs (stock keeping units), frequent inventory updates, temperature-sensitive drugs, and risk of expired or counterfeit items. The company wants to optimize operations, reduce losses, and improve customer service.

Machine Learning Categories:
Supervised Learning
Definition: Model learns from labeled data. It knows the "correct" answers during training.

Goal: Predict an outcome based on input features.

ðŸ’¡ Pharma Warehouse Example:
Problem: Predict if a medicine will be delivered late based on various inputs.

Input Features:
Distance to delivery location
Order time
Weather condition
Stock availability
Transport provider
Historical delay record
Label: Delivered_Late â†’ Yes / No
