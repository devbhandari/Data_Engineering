AI: consists of 
    1)Computer Vision : 
    2)NLP : 
    3)Generative AI :
    4)Deep Learning : Multi Layered neural networks,automatically extract features from big data 
    5)Machine Learning: 
        ~ Uses algorithms, requires feature engineering
        ~ Teaches computer to learn from data, identify patterns and make decision
        ~ Algorithms : used computational methods for learning, Does not rely on a fixed algorithm
            a) Supervised learning models: train on labelled data to learn how to make inferenes on new data,Enabling them to predict otherwise unknown labels.
            b) UnSupervised Learning models:Works without labels by finding patterns in data.
            c) Semisupervised learning trains on relatively small subset of the data that is already labeled.

Example : 
Pharma Warehouse
Imagine a pharmaceutical warehouse where medicines are stored, picked, packed, and shipped. There are thousands of SKUs (stock keeping units), frequent inventory updates, temperature-sensitive drugs, and risk of expired or counterfeit items. The company wants to optimize operations, reduce losses, and improve customer service.

Machine Learning Categories:
1) Supervised Learning
Definition: Model learns from labeled data. It knows the "correct" answers during training.

Goal: Predict an outcome based on input features.

ðŸ’¡ Pharma Warehouse Example:
Problem: Predict if a medicine will be delivered late based on various inputs.

Input Features:
Distance to delivery location
Order time
Weather condition
Stock availability
Transport provider
Historical delay record
Label: Delivered_Late â†’ Yes / No

# Sample training data
Order_ID | Distance_km | Weather | In_Stock | Delivered_Late
-------- | ----------- | ------- | -------- | ---------------
101      | 250         | Clear   | Yes      | No
102      | 180         | Rainy   | No       | Yes
103      | 120         | Clear   | Yes      | No


Use Case: You train a supervised learning model like Random Forest or XGBoost to predict delivery delays in real time.

2) Unsupervised Learning
Definition: No labeled data; the algorithm tries to find hidden patterns or groupings.
Goal: Discover segments or anomalies.

ðŸ’¡ Pharma Warehouse Example:
Problem: Detect unusual stock movement patterns or cluster similar products based on attributes.

Input:
Medicine ID
Shelf Life
Storage Temp
Pick Frequency
Volume per unit
Price

ðŸ§  Use Case 1: Use clustering (e.g., KMeans) to group medicines into fast-moving, moderate-moving, and slow-moving classes to optimize shelf layout.
ðŸ§  Use Case 2: Use anomaly detection (e.g., Isolation Forest) to detect when a usually low-demand medicine suddenly starts moving unusually fast (possible fraud, counterfeit circulation, or health outbreak indicator).

3. Semi-Supervised Learning
Definition: Combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data.
Goal: Improve performance when full labeling is too costly/time-consuming.

ðŸ’¡ Pharma Warehouse Example:
Problem: You want to classify drugs as "Critical", "Moderate", or "Low Priority" for temperature-sensitive handling, but only 5% of historical records are labeled.

Data Available:
Temperature control requirement
Transportation mode
Delivery delays
Fragility
Storage duration

You use the small labeled dataset to initially train a model and apply it to unlabeled data to guess the remaining labels, then retrain the model with more confidence.

ðŸ§  Use Case: Efficient classification of cold-chain critical drugs without needing a pharmacist to manually label every entry.
